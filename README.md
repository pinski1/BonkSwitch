# BonkSwitch
For the remote control of 2 solenoids.

<!-- 3D image of the board here -->

## Specification

* Will accept +30V (8s) to +52 (12s) input voltages on an XT60 connector
* Will drive 2 solenoids with +24V at 60W each via XT30 connectors.
* Has an on board [FrSky XM](https://www.frsky-rc.com/product/xm-1g-sbus-non-telemetry/) reciever with 15 channels
* Will accept any [Adafruit Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/feather-specification) compatible microcontroller board.
* Has voltage monitoring of all power rails and current monitoring of solenoids

While example code is provided it will require modification for your application & chosen Feather.

## Current status

Currently the PCB is in the final stages of review and should be finalised shortly.

The firmware efforts are still on going, although the majority of the work can only be completed once the hardware is available.
